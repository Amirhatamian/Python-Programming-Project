# NBA Data Analysis and Visualization Using Streamlit

## Overview
This project provides an interactive dashboard for exploring and analyzing NBA datasets using Streamlit. It leverages Python's data analysis and visualization libraries to offer insights into NBA games, teams, and rankings.

## Features
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Machine learning integration for predictive modeling and analysis.
- Data filtering and exploration through an intuitive Streamlit interface.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas: For data manipulation.
  - numpy: For numerical computations.
  - matplotlib & seaborn: For static data visualizations.
  - plotly: For interactive visualizations.
  - scikit-learn: For machine learning models.
  - streamlit: For creating the interactive web-based dashboard.

## File Structure
- Python Script: The main Streamlit application script for running the dashboard.
- Data:
  - games_details.csv: Detailed information about individual games.
  - teams.csv: Information about NBA teams.
  - games.csv: Summary of game results.
  - rankings.csv: Team rankings over time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries installed:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn streamlit


### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nba-streamlit-analysis.git cd nba-streamlit-analysis
2. Ensure the required datasets are in the correct directory. Update file paths in the script if needed.
3. Run the Streamlit application:
streamlit run Streamlit_Project_Programming.py
4. Access the dashboard in your browser and explore the data.

## Key Functionalities
1. **Data Loading**:
- Load NBA datasets including games, teams, rankings, and game details.
2. **Data Visualization**:
- Create static and interactive visualizations to explore trends and insights.
3. **Predictive Modeling**:
- Implement machine learning models for predictive analysis of NBA game outcomes.
4. **Interactive Features**:
- Use Streamlit widgets for data filtering, input selection, and dynamic updates.

## Results
The dashboard enables users to explore NBA datasets interactively, visualize trends, and perform basic predictive modeling to analyze game outcomes.
